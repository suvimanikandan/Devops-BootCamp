🖊️Chapter 11:TextEditors    
👉Text editors (rather than word processing programs) are used quite often in Linux, for tasks such as creating or modifying system configuration files, writing scripts, developing source code, etc.       
👉nano is an easy-to-use text-based editor that utilizes on-screen prompts.         
👉gedit is a graphical editor, very similar to Notepad in Windows.           
👉The vi editor is available on all Linux systems and is very widely used. Graphical extension versions of vi are widely available as well.      
👉emacs is available on all Linux systems as a popular alternative to vi. emacs can support both a graphical user interface and a text mode interface.                   
👉To access the vi tutorial, type vimtutor at a command line window.          
👉To access the emacs tutorial type Ctl-h and then t from within emacs.         
👉vi has three modes: Command, Insert, and Line. emacs has only one, but requires use of special keys, such as Control and Escape.            
👉Both editors use various combinations of keystrokes to accomplish tasks. The learning curve to master these can be long, but once mastered using either editor is extremely efficient.
