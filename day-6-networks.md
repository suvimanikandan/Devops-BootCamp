ðŸ‘‰The Basic Meaning of Routers and Switches  
A router is a networking device used to connect multiple switches and their corresponding networks to build a large network.   

On the other hand, a switch is a networking device, which provides the facility to share the information & resources by connecting different network devices, such as computers, printers, and servers, within a small business network.   

ðŸ‘‰Types of Switches   
1)Unmanaged Switches   
The unmanaged switches are primarily used for basic connectivity in small networks or wherever only a few more ports are required, such as at home,   
in a lab, or in a conference room. In unmanaged switches, thereâ€™s no requirement for any configuration, which suggests by just plugging in, theyâ€™re going to work.   

2)Managed Switches   
Managed switches are more secure than unmanaged switches, providing other features and flexibility as they can be easily configured to custom-fit the network.  
  Hence, we can have greater control, and can also better protect our network and improve service quality for those who access the network.    
  
ðŸ‘‰Types of Routers   
1)Wireless Router    
As the name suggests this type of routers do not require any wires or cables to function and can only be accessed by authenticated users using id    
and password making it a hassle free and secure way to connect to networking devices.     

2)Wired Router/Broadband Router    
These types of routers require a wire or cable to connect and are mostly used in schools and offices to connect to network devices via ethernet.    
It is connected to the ADSL modems to take the transmission data from the modem and distribute it to an extra network.
