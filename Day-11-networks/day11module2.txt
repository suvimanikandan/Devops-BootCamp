Types of networks: LAN: • In the example above, a LAN with one router, two switches, and three nodes under each switch. Each switch or subnet, can represent an office floor or building within the same corporate office or school.
• LANs commonly use the Ethernet standard for connecting devices, and they usually have a high data-transfer rate.
• Wireless technology is also commonly used for a LAN   

WAN: • In the example above, a WAN with three routers, two switches and three nodes under each switch. Examples of WANs are two corporate offices located across the United States connected by a WAN (the internet).
• WANs use technologies such as fiber-optic cables and satellites to transmit data which are used to connect LANs.
• The internet is considered to be the largest WAN.  

LAN VS WAN 
LAN:
Within the same building or floor. WAN: Can be geographically different locations;
 however, they are connected by a corporate WAN  

Network Toplogies:What is a network topology? • 
A topology is a pattern (or diagram) that shows how nodes connect to each other.
 • Computer networks use different topologies to share information. 
• The two topologies are: • Physical topology – Refers to the physical layout of wires in the network 
• Logical topology – Refers to how data moves through the network.  

its important to understand network management models because they define
the roles and relationships of the devices in your network.
 • Examples of network topologies include: Bus, Star, Mesh, and Hybrid    

 What is a physical topology? • Refers to how a network is connected.
• Examples of network topologies include: Bus, Star, Mesh, and Hybrid. • Bus topology: • The physical topology positions all the devices on a network along a
single cable. They run in a single direction from one end of the network to the other. A bus topology is also called a line topology or backbone topology.
• This is simple to configure, however, it only allows one computer to send a signal at a time, which can cause network collisions that will bring down the network.
• Star topology: • The physical topology is set up so that every node in the network is
directly connected to one central switch by using coaxial, twisted-pair, or fiber-optic cables.
• Mesh topology: • A mesh topology is a complex structure of connections that are
similar to peer-to-peer, where the nodes are interconnected. Mesh networks can be full mesh or partial mesh.
• In a partial-mesh topology, all devices are connected to at least two other devices  
 In a full-mesh topology, all nodes are interconnected. A full-mesh topology provides full redundancy for the network. It is an expensive topology because it requires each node to have multiple network adapters and cables. You will most likely find a full-mesh topology in a WAN.
• Hybrid topology: • A hybrid topology combines two or more different topology structures. It is usually found in large organizations where separate departments have personalized network topologies to accommodate their network usage and other requirements. • Today, the star-bus topology is the most common hybrid topology.

Logical TOplogy: What is a logical topology? • Refers to how data moves through a network.
• Examples of logical topologies include: Bus, Star, Mesh, Hybrid, and VPC. • Bus topology: • The logical topology and data flow on the network also follows the route of the cable, it moves in one direction.
• This is simple to configure; however, it only allows one computer to send a signal at a time, which can cause network collisions that will bring down the network.
• Star topology: • The logical topology works with the central switch managing data transmission. Data that is sent from any node on the network must pass through the central switch to reach its destination. The central switch can also function as a repeater to prevent data loss.
• Mesh topology: • A mesh topology is a complex structure of connections that are
similar to peer-to-peer, where the nodes are interconnected. Mesh networks can be full mesh or partial mesh.
• In a partial-mesh topology, all devices are connected to at least two other devices.
• In a full-mesh topology, all nodes are interconnected. A full-mesh topology provides full redundancy for the network. It is an expensive topology because it requires each node to have multiple network adapters and cables. You will most likely find a full-mesh topology in a WAN.
• Hybrid topology: • A hybrid topology combines two or more different topology structures. It is usually found in large organizations where separate departments have personalized network topologies to accommodate their network usage and other requirements. • Today, the star-bus topology is the most common hybrid topology.
• VPC topology: • Is a virtual network that allows you to launch AWS resources that you define. It’s a logical network.

AMAZON VIRTUAL PRIVATE CLOUD:
Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
What is a Amazon VPC?
 • An Amazon VPC is a virtual network that allows you to launch AWS resources that you define. 
This VPC looks and works just like a normal network within a data center with the benefits of using AWS services for scalability.
Please note that this is just a simple comparison of services between a
traditional topology and AWS services. • An isolated network, most closely resembles the function of a VPC. Within an Amazon VPC, you can launch multiple AWS services and capabilities that are needed to create a working, scalable network. However, within an Amazon VPC, there is no maintenance required, and you can create an isolated architecture within minutes!
• A network segment acts as a subnet and separates a network between offices or buildings. AWS uses subnets in every architecture. Every node (EC2 instance) belongs in a subnet.
• Firewalls block traffic based on a set of rules. AWS has security groups that block traffic at the node (EC2 level) and NACLs that block traffic at the subnet level. These also block traffic based on a set of rules.
• Within a data center, there are servers. Within AWS, you can use an EC2 instance to launch an array of servers.

Network management
What is network management? • A network management model is a representation of how data is managed, and how applications are hosted in a network.
• The two most common models for LAN are: • Client-server • Peer-to-peer  

Client-server model
What is a client-server model? • The data management and application hosting are centralized at the server and distributed to the clients.
All clients on the network must use the designated server to access shared files and information that are stored on the serving computer.

What is a peer-to-peer model? • In this model, each node has its own data and applications and is responsible for its own management and security.
Peer
The peer-to-peer model is a distributed architecture that shares tasks or workloads among peers.  

What is a network protocol? • A network protocol defines the rules for formatting and transmitting data between devices on a network.
• It typically operates at layer 3 (Network) and layer 4 (Transport) of the OSI model. • It falls into two categories:Connection-oriented protocol
Connectionless protocol
• An example of a connection-oriented protocol is a phone call between two people. One person calls and the other answers and therefore a connection is established.
• An example of a connectionless protocol is sending a package through the mail to another person. Once it leaves your hands, the package can get to its destination or it can get lost. It doesn’t require a connection to be established.

Connection-oriented protocol
What is a connection-oriented protocol? • It is a protocol that establishes a connection. • It waits for a response. • It creates a session between the sender and the receiver. • It uses synchronous communication.
A connection-oriented protocol works similar to a person calling another person and they answer. The connection is then established.
 With a connection-oriented protocol, there is typically a larger overhead because it ensures that a connection is established.
• It checks if the message was received or not received. If the message was received, a session is then established. If an error occurs or the message is not received, it sends the message again.
• It uses synchronous communication which means it happens in real time. For example, it requires two parties to establish a connection like a phone call between two people.

Connectionless protocol
What is a connectionless protocol? • It sends a message from one endpoint to the other, without ensuring that the destination is available and ready to receive the data.
• It does not require a session between the sender and receiver. • It uses asynchronous communication.
A connectionless protocol is like sending mail. You don’t know if the receiver is available or not to receive it, and it happens asynchronously.

 ex:With a connectionless protocol, there is typically little overhead because it doesn’t care if there is a session established.
• This is faster then a connection-oriented protocol and uses asynchronous communication which means that one of the parties does not have to be available for data to be sent.
• As far as connectionless protocol is concerned, it just sends the data and it doesn’t care if the receiving end gets the data or not.
• An example of this is like sending mail. You mail a letter or package and once it leave your mailbox or post office it is asynchronous between the sender and receiver. The party isn’t readily available to receive the package and you won’t know exactly when they will be, you just sent the mail hoping they will get it.

EXAMPLE OF NETWORK PROTOCOL  
TCP/IP is a connection-oriented protocol. It defines how to establish and maintain network communication in which application programs can exchange data. Data sent via this protocol is broken down into smaller chunks called packets. The goal of TCP/IP was to support an interconnection of networks (internet).
• TCP is great for transferring important files since there is a guarantee of connection, even though there is a larger overhead (time).
• With TCP, there is something called the TCP handshake. This handshake is
comprised of three messages: • Synchronize (SYN) • Synchronize/Acknowledge (SYN/ACK) • Acknowledge (ACK)
• During this handshake, the protocol establishes parameters that support the data transfer between two hosts. For example: • Host A sends a SYN packet to Host B. • Host B sends the SYN with an ACK attached to acknowledge that they received it with the message back to Host A.
• Host A sends the last message with ACK to Host B letting them know they received the SYN/ACK message.
• UDP uses connectionless communication and there is no guarantee of the delivery or ordering of data. The best example and use case of UDP is media. When streaming services such as a movie, UDP is used because it is fast,owever, there are times when you might see buffering and things may seem off or out of order like the words do not match up to the picture. That is UDP delivering the data and the streaming service trying to order the data as UDP doesn’t guarantee the order or delivery.

TCP HANDSHAKEWAY :
TCP is great for transferring important files since there is a guarantee of connection, even though there is a larger overhead (time).
• It is connection oriented. • With TCP, there is something called the TCP handshake. This handshake is comprised of three messages: • Synchronize (SYN) • Synchronize/Acknowledge (SYN/ACK) • Acknowledge (ACK)
• During this handshake, the protocol establishes parameters that support the data transfer between two hosts. For example: • Host A sends a SYN packet to Host B. • Host B sends the SYN with an ACK attached to acknowledge that they received it with the message back to Host A.
• Host A sends the last message with ACK to Host B letting them know they received the SYN/ACK message.
• There is also a process where it gracefully closes the communication between sender and receiver (similar to saying good-bye to someone) with
three messages: • Finish (FIN) • Finish/Acknowledge (FIN/ACK) • Acknowledge (ACK)
• There are also something called reset (RST) flags when a connection closes abruptly and causes and error.

UDP:• UDP uses connectionless communication and there is no guarantee of the delivery or ordering of data. The best example and use case of UDP is media. When streaming services such as a movie, UDP is used because it is fast, however, there are times when you might see buffering and things may seem off or out of order like the words do not match up to the picture. That is UDP delivering the data and the streaming service trying to order the data as UDP doesn’t guarantee the order or delivery.
• It is about speed and doesn’t provide a three way handshake to ensure data is delivered.
• It has minimum set of functions and is considered unreliable compared to TCP.

some keytakeways:A local-area network (LAN) connects devices in a limited geographical area, and a wide-area network (WAN) connects devices in a large geographical area.
A network management model defines how data is managed, and how applications are hosted in a network. Client-server and peer-to-peer are two common network management models for a LAN.
A network topology shows how nodes connect to each other. Star and hybrid are example patterns of a network typology.
A VPC is a virtual network that allows you to launch AWS resources that you define. A VPC looks and works just like a normal network within a data center with the benefits of using AWS services for scalability.
A network protocol defines the rules for formatting and transmitting data between devices on a network.
