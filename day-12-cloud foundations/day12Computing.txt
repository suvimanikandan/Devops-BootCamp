Introduction to computing  

Computer application:An application is a computer program. It’s a set of instructions that run on a computer to perform a specific function.
Programs can be written in many different programming languages, such as Java, Python, and C++.
The term software is synonymous with computer programs.  

Many different types of applications exist. They can be differentiated based on what type of device they run on and how they are accessed.
The following list contains some examples of different types of applications:
• Web application – Anything that can be accessed through a web browser, such as Mozilla Firefox—for example, amazon.com
• Mobile application – Amazon Shopping Mobile App, your bank’s mobile banking app
• Desktop application – Word processors, web browsers, games, video editing software, and programming tools
• Internet of Things (IoT) application – Application on a smartwatch or inside a smart refrigerator, global positioning system (GPS) navigation application in a car

A computer contains hardware and software. Hardware refers to a computer’s physical components, such as its central processing unit (CPU), memory, and storage drive. Software is the collection of applications and programs that are installed on the computer. For example, software includes an operating system (OS) such as Amazon Linux, and an application such as the Amazon Shopping Mobile App.
The main hardware components inside a computer are: 
• CPU 
• Memory
 • Storage drive
 • Network card
The main software components are:
 • OS
 • Applications
You learn more about each of these components in the next slides.  

Motherboard  Also called the system board, the motherboard holds together all the computer’s hardware pieces: random access memory (RAM), CPU, hard drive, network, and video cards.

CPU: The CPU is the electronic circuitry in a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program. 
It performs the basic arithmetic, logical, control, and input/output (I/O) operations that the instructions specify.
A CPU with multiple cores increases performance. For example, a dual-core CPU has two cores, which act as two separate CPUs. 
This arrangement enables the OS to run two separate applications at the same time, and therefore, speed up the system.  


Memory:Memory, also called RAM, is the hardware component that stores the OS, application programs, and data in current use. In this way, the CPU can access these resources quickly.
The basic unit of measurement for memory is bytes, where a byte represents the amount of memory needed to store a character (8 bits). Because memory sizes in computers today are large, they are typically measured in units of megabytes (MB) or gigabytes (GB). A MB is approximately one million bytes, and a GB is approximately one billion bytes.
More memory enables the OS to load more applications into memory at once, or keep all of an application’s data in memory at one time. The result is improved system performance.

Storage:Storage drives are used to store and retrieve digital data, such as documents, programs, application preferences, and more.
Hard disk drives (HDDs) are the traditional and most popular type of storage drives. They use a mechanical system of spinning magnetic disks to store data and provide an inexpensive storage solution.
Solid state drives (SSDs) are now gaining more popularity. They have no mechanical parts, and they use flash-based memory (integrated circuits) to store data. As a result, they are significantly faster than hard disk drives but more expensive.
The performance characteristics of a storage drive are typically measured in terms of its data access speed in MB per second (MB/s) or I/O operations per second (IOPS).

Computer networks:An application that runs on a given computer might interact with other applications that run on different computers to access information and complete its function. For example, mobile apps often communicate with other applications that run on a web server to get data. A computer network enables these different computers to connect and communicate with each other.
In a wired network, computers are connected to a router by using wires, typically Ethernet cables. In a wireless network, computers connect to a router by using the router’s Wi-Fi signal. You will learn more about routers later in the course.

NIC:A network interface card, also called network adapter, connects a computer to a computer network. It uses a cable that’s connected to a hub or switch.
A wired network card uses an Ethernet cable to connect a computer to the network. A wireless network card uses a Wi-Fi signal instead.
A network card’s performance is measured by its transmission speed in gigabits per second (Gbps)

OSS:OS manages a computer’s hardware and software. You also use it to interact with your computer.
Some applications work only on specific operating systems.

Some key takeaways from this lesson include: • Applications, computers, and networks enable the digital world.
• An application is a computer program. It’s a set of instructions that a computer runs to perform a specific task.
• A computer’s hardware consists of its physical components, such as its CPU, memory, storage drive, and network card.
• A computer’s software consists of the programs that run on it, such as its OS and user applications
