🖋️Chapter 8:finding linux documentation   
👉The main sources of Linux documentation are the man pages, GNU info, the help options and command, and a rich variety of online documentation sources.     
👉The man utility searches, formats, and displays man pages.    
👉The man pages provide in-depth documentation about programs and other topics about the system, including configuration files, system calls, library routines, and the kernel.    
👉The GNU Info System was created by the GNU project as its standard documentation. It is robust and is accessible via command line, web, and graphical tools using info. 
👉Short descriptions for commands are usually displayed with the -h or --help argument.   
👉You can type help at the command line to display a synopsis of built-in commands.   
👉There are many other help resources both on your system and on the Internet.
