os-translator     
1)Manage resource among application   
2)isolates content of application    



Task of an Os:    
1)resource allocation management     
     ⬇️     
2)Cpu-Process Management    ->managing cpu resources    
     ⬇️    
3)Memory- Memory Management  ->allocating Working Memory      
     ⬇️    
4)Storage Management   ->Secondary Memory       
      ⬇️   
5)i/o devices

What is process?
->small unit that executes on a computer   ex:opening terminal and otheer  
->each  process has own isolated space   

CPU process management  
->1 process at a time   
->1 cpu can only process 1 task at a timme  
->cpu is switching so test you dont notice it   
multiple cpu 
->dual-core-s cpus-2 processor
->quad-core =4 cpus-4processor  
the more cpus the faster that applications work  

MEMORY MANAGEMENT  
->RAM-rapid acess memory
->allocating working memory
->every application needs some data to work  
->Ram is limited on computer  

MEMORY MANAGEMENT 
->Memory swapping
->os swaps memory between application   
->one app becomes inactive,new one gets resources  
->slow down the computers  
->the process takes some times   

STORAGE MANAGEMENT  
->Also  called secondary memory  
->Ram_>working memory ->actively processing data 
->persisting data long-term
->hard drive of computers  
->stroing data and allocating memory resources

MANAGE FILE SYSTEM:
->stroed in structured way   
->in unix system:tree file System    
->in windows os:multiple root folder   

MANAGEMENT OF I/O DEVICES 
->monitor,cpu,scanner,printer,keyboard   
->os knows how to handle and translate intersections between app and devices   


SECURITY & NETWORKING   
->managing users and permissions  
->each user has its own space  
->each user has permissions   

Networking   
->port and ip addresses   


How an operating system is consturized
opertaing system components    


->kernel starts the process of the apps  
->alloactes resources to app  
->cleans up the resources when app shut down   
->kernel is a program   
->consist of device drivers,dispatcher ,scheduler,file system etc,.



OPERATING SYSTEM FOR SERVER:
->mostly based on linx  
->nO gui or other user applicant  
->more light weighted and performant   

HOW TO INTERACT WIITH KERNEL   
->Graphical user interface   
->Command line interface   

3main operating systems   
1)windows  
2)linux  
3)mac os  
->each os has many variants   
->kernel stays the same   


summary:   
1)operating systems is powering all devices   
2)IOS,ANDROID etc are operating system   
3)ANDROID is based on linux kernel 
4)MACOS and IOS are darwin kernel
