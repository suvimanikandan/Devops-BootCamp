✔️Yaml- yaml means ain't mark up language  

▶️data format used to exchange data  
▶️similar to xml and json  
▶️in yaml, you can store only data,and not commands   

✔️ data serialization & deserialization:    
▶️serialization- process of converting data objects into complex data structure in the stream of bits  
📓 obj -> stream(chunks of data) ->computer

▶️reverse  processof the serilization is called deserialization    
                       stream of bytes    ▶️YAML
object --->serializer ---------------->    ▶️databases   
code + data                                 ▶️memory   

▶️process of converting  a dta abject which is combination of code and data into series of bytes that saves the state of this object in the  
form that is easily tranmsiatable called serialization     
▶️above of the reverse process called deserialization   

✔️data serializatiion language language:yaml,json,xml 
✔️represent of data in code  
✔️store data in the format of code  u use convert into an object  

▶️object to yaml file-serialization  
▶️yaml file to object-deserialization    
▶️yaml is a data serialization langauge not a programmming langauge,store in the form of objects  

▶️markup language stores documents  
▶️yaml stores objects  

✔️what type of stored in yaml file?   
▶️configuartion file  
▶️kubernetes file  
▶️docker file
▶️yaml is a markup langauge used to store data serialzation language    
example:docker file,kubernetes file,  
▶️logs,caches etc..,  

✔️Benefits of the yaml:   
▶️Human readable
▶️simple  
▶️easy to read  
▶️it has a strict syntax  
▶️indentation is important  
▶️easily convertable to json,xml  
▶️most programming langauge used in yaml  
▶️popular  
▶️more powerful when representing complex data  
▶️various tools,parsers etc..,  
▶️pasing is easing(parsing means reading data)  
  
  ✔️Demo of yaml file   
  ▶️key-value pairs:   
  
  key ----->value
