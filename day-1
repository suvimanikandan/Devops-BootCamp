#Introduction to Devops



Different IT roles in software development & process

Software Development:   
Software programmed by developers   
In different programming languages,like java,python javascript etc;   
new functionality and bugfixes   

Software Testing:      
: Test new features and old features   
: Done by developers and dedicated testers   
: manual and automated Testing     


Release of Software  
: Operations:
: Build application          
:Release of Software       
:Upgrade the exisiting software    
done by operations team   
 
 Traditional development :
1) Miscommunication and collaboration
2)conflict of interest
3) manual work& checklist
 this is the slow of the software release process
 
 Solution: Devops culture
 Simple definition: Intersection of development &operations  -> devops was a justway of working between dev's and op's
 ->common language to communicate
 
    #Devops is about making the process of continous delivery fase with minimal errors
    #Instead of manual inefficient process help create a fully streamlined process of release cycles
    
    #Devops as a seperate role

Devops tool that are today
1) Source code management-GIT
2)Package Management-DOCKER
3)Infrastructure as a code: TERRAFORM,ANSIBLE
4)continous integration/delivery-JENKINS,GITLAB
5)Container Orchestration-KUBERNETES
6)CLOUD:AWS,AZURE,GCloud
7)Continous Monitoring:PROMETHUS

--->replace human task with automation tools
--->AT the core of devops:CI/CD for an automated release process
commitcode -> test->build ->push ->deploy
